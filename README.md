# SongLyricsGenerator
## Here's how to use Artificial Intelligence to write a song that doesn'tÂ exist.

Hy you all guys. This GitHub repository consists of three files. 

* "final_taylor_swift_lyrics.tsv" is the dataset that [I've used](https://www.kaggle.com/pradhanmanva/taylorswiftlyrics) 
* "datapreprocessing.ipynb" is the notebook that permits you to isolate certain part of the songs (e.g. I've picked the choruses)
* "choruses_generator.ipynb" is the notebook that permits you to write choruses, in a very simple way.

Enjoy it! 

Piero.
